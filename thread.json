You can have struct constructors (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/l<wbr>ibrary/aa288208%28v=vs.71%29.aspx) but no explicit default values. Specific default values are generally considered bad style, especially for &quot;data only&quot;, since using them gets rid of quite a bit of flexibility because it is not the responsibility of the data holder to decide which values it should hold.<br>The default values of structs are generally the default values of the types you are using, which are: <br>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/li<wbr>brary/83fhsxwc.aspx<br>Struct members are initialized to their default as well and all object types are pointers in C# so those are presumably initialized to null.",
